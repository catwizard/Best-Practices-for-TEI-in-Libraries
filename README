This repository contains the ODD ( http://wiki.tei-c.org/index.php/ODD ) 
source files for "Best Practices for TEI in Libraries: A guide for mass 
digitization, automated workflows, and promotion of interoperability 
with XML using the TEI" ( http://purl.oclc.org/NET/teiinlibraries ).

To check out a copy of this repository to your local system so you can
look at and play with the files (i.e., read-only) use:
   git clone git://github.com/sydb/TEI-in-Libraries.git

To check out an initial copy of this repository to your local system
to work on it (i.e., read-write), use either:
   git clone git@github.com:sydb/TEI-in-Libraries.git
or
   git clone https://sydb@github.com/sydb/TEI-in-Libraries.git
(I'm not sure of the difference.)-:

In order to commit changes, you will need to send your GitHub username
to the owner of this project and follow the steps at:
   http://help.github.com/
in order to generate a keypair.

To generate schemas (RELAX NG; or, if you can't use RELAX NG you can
also generate DTDs and W3C XML Schema), either submit the ODD files
the TEI "Roma" website[1] or, having installed `roma`[2] on your
machine[3] issue something like
$ roma2 --patternprefix=lib3_ --noxsd --dochtml --nodtd --isoschematron lib3.odd .

To generate the main HTML documentation for the entire system, use
something like
$ xmllint --xinclude main-driver.odd > /tmp/main-driver.odd
$ ~/Documents/Stylesheets/teitohtml /tmp/main-driver.odd
If `teitohtml` does not run on your system, you could submit the
/tmp/main-driver.odd file to the OUCS OxGarage service
(http://oxgarage.oucs.ox.ac.uk:8080/ege-webclient/) instead.

    produces schemas and reference documentation.
